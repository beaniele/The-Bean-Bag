                <div>omg I look so chummy... <br> Heyo! I'm Leona, and as you can probably tell by now, I scraped this blog together. I'm 15, Vietnamese-American, and currently a freshman in highschool, and love coding - mainly for all the hardware projects I come up with and do. Reading, listening to music and zoning out are also some of my favorite things to do when there's time to kill. I partake in piano, guitar, swimming, track, and sleeping. If I do say so myself, sleeping is by far the hardest sport any human can experience.<br>My alone time is something I value, but that doesn't mean I'm not up for meeting new people or conversing on the daily. I don't really have much going on for me, other than school, studying, and my extra-curriculars. As you can probably already tell by now, I'm a pretty plain person, really.<br>Despite this, I hope that doesn't stop you from reading on, even if it's just for a little while. Feel free to scroll down in order to go indept on my specific interests, or switch over to another tab on this blog!<br><br>..I seriously need to get my friend back for clipping me so chummy -_-</div>

                <div>As mentioned above, listening to music is something I enjoy very much. It's calming, serves as a great moral boost whenever I'm doing passive tasks, and just sets the vibe.<br>One of the genres I enjoy indulging in every now and then is K-pop, yet I only tune in every now and then to catch up on releases.<br>I've been a listener since the beginning of the pandemic when there really wasn't anything - so nearly 5-6 years now! I was scrounging Youtube one day, where I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rMiEjNaCSsebs31MRDCRA">Stray Kid's</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/TQTlCHxyuu8?si=drEAQmcO2gFj5rQa"> God's Menu</a>, and was instantly hooked. We can ALL agree that is was thanks to Felix's deep ass voice that lured me into the fandom, which I've been in since discovering the group. Over time, I branched out to many others, such as IVE, TXT, KATSEYE, LE SSERAFIM, TWICE, and most importantly, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5t5FqBwTcgKTaWmfEbwQY9">Enhypen.</a> Being introduced to Enhypen felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/X7d6Dt17yHk?si=rweCB62EeJqa4pZd">fever</a> dream, really. Their discography was much different compared to skz's, but in a good and discrete way. Too keep it short, I found myself leaning towards Enha, and moreso <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HYBELABELS">HYBE</a> groups. I still listen to skz and all the other groups that got me into K-pop, but Enhypen have proven to be my ults from time to time<br><br>sunoo to keep you scrolling :P</div>

                <div>Aside from K-pop, I love listening to other artists. As you can probably tell by now, I'm a huge music enthusiast. The artists I enjoy listening to are as follows: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/72NhFAGG5Pt91VbheJeEPG">2hollis</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/45dkTj5sMRSjrmBSBeiHym">Tate McRae</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/41X1TR6hrK8Q2ZCpp2EqCz">bbno$</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6qqNVTkY8uBg9cP3Jd7DAH">Billie Eilish</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Uc8Dsxct0oMqx0P6i60ea">Conan Gray</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7eKkW1zo5uzW8kUntiiBvz">Malcom Todd</a>.<br>I must say, however, Billie Eilish's music has a special place in <em>all</em> my playlists. Getting a bit deep with the info, but it was her songs that helped me cope with my anxieties and overthinking when I was alone found it difficult to deal with my mental health. Her album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0S0KGZnfBGSIssfF54WSJh"><em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</em></a> houses my two favorite songs of her discography: 'when the party's over' and 'i love you'. If you're new to her music, or haven't listened to them yet, I highly reccomend listening if they're your cup of tea.</div>

                <div>SHADOW MILK COOKIE🥹🥹 -<br> ahem.<br>My friend (re)introduced me to <a href="https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/Cookie_Run:_Kingdom_Wiki">Cookie Run Kingdom</a> about a year ago, right when the <a href="https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/Song_of_the_Night_Sea/Story"><u>'Song of the Night Sea'</u></a> update was taking place. I had an account on the Pure Vanilla server a couple years back, but lost it due to my adolescence and lack of understanding for the game. Given my comeback, I told myself I'd actually take it upon myself to pay attention to the story and understand the whole storyline of the game. And boy, have I not regretted doing so. I remember trying to indulge further into <u>crk's</u> lore, when I stumbled across a patch note leak talking about Shadow Milk cookie's future release. Honestly don't know what was so alluring about him that instantly made me want to pull him from his gacha banner during his release period, but as I scrounged his given backstory by <a href="https://www.devsisters.com/en"> DEVSIS</a>, the parenting company of the cookie run franchise. Simply put, I resonated with the majority of his personality and character build, and it's safe to say that ever since my discovery of him, he's been my favorite. The game overall is extremely enjoyable. Towards the end of each day, I unwind by playing for an hour or so. And whenever I'm doing anything passive, such as cleaning my room, coding, or anything else that doesn't really require much thought, I listen to the 'Cutscene Theatre' episodes provided by crk's youtube team - basically the storyline without game play interruption. Peak fiction, if you ask me, both the gameplay, and the storyline, and omg don't get me started on the art. However, that, is a later conversation for the future.</div>

                <div>why do i lwk have an infatuation with problem children...<br>I won't get into my interest in reading as much here, since that's what the <a href="nook.html">'Nook'</a> tab is for, but to make up for it, I'll shortly dive into my anime interests. Ah yes, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/">Anime</a>, the place of origin for all my nerdy interests. From Blue Lock to Blue Period, My Hero Academia to The Apothocary Diaries, and giants like Demon Slayer and Attack on Titan, I say it's safe to claim that I've dedicated countless hours watching series that were either reccomended to me, or ones I stumbled across and somehow managed to stick with. My interest in anime grew when my dad bought the second volume of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81318842"><em>'Blue Period'</em></a> for me on my kindle. It was my first experience with how manga was supposed to be read, and the casualty of series being adapted into animation. Obviously, I was in awe, and began branching out. <a href="https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/My_Hero_Academia_Wiki">My Hero Academia</a> was one of, if not the only show(s) I started watching during its release, and stayed with until it ended. As you can tell, Bakugo is my favorite out of all the characters shown, but for the same reasons as to why I like Shadow Milk Cookie. To some context, I can relate to his drive and want to be the best when it comes to academics. I honestly don't really know how to explain everything else, but yeah that's basically it!<br><br>If you'd like to know more about my current watches, or what I've already watched, feel free to explore more in the <a href="nook.html">'Nook'</a> tab!</div>

                <div>I loveeee pokemon, and as you can probably tell by the image, Reshiram's my favorite (still haven't pulled its chase card yet tho T^T).<br>I've been playing <a href ="https://www.pokemon.com/us">Pokemon Go</a> since before the pandemic, and recently downloaded the <a href="https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-gb/">TCG</a> - though, I do admit, opening online packs isn't as exciting compared to cracking open real packs. I'm pretty sure <a href="https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/expansions/destined-rivals/">Destined Rivals</a> is the only set I have finished...I don't know, I'll have to check. But let's just say that despite all the chase cards popping up every now and then with the new releases, I STILL have yet to get Reshiram - I LOVE the <a href="https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/expansions/black-white/">Scarlet & Violet White Flare</a> pack. I swear to god and everyone who's gotten and lists it on ebay sells it for such high prices like bro :C. And don't get me started on scalpers... I literally have no words.<br>But yeah! Pokemon in general is just a little side hobby - sometimes hustle - whenever I got time to kill and don't want to accidentally doomscroll :P.<br> damn those scalpers..</div>

            <p> I'd go on and on about my other interests, but I have a tendency to yap, so this is the end...for now. Who knows? I might add more in the future, but for now, that'll be it regarding me! If you made it this far, that's great, and hopefully you enjoy exploring the rest of this blog (｢•-•)｢</p>
